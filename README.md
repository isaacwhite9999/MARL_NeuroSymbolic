# MARL Neuro-Symbolic

**MARL Neuro-Symbolic** is a cutting-edge simulation platform that integrates Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) with Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning. In this project, multiple agents learn to cooperate (or compete) in a custom grid-world environment using Deep Q-Learning, while a neuro-symbolic module generates human-readable explanations for their actions.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates:
- **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning:** Agents learn in a cooperative grid-world environment using Deep Q-Learning.
- **Custom Environment:** A grid-world where agents start at the top-left corner and strive to reach the goal at the bottom-right.
- **Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning:** Symbolic explanations provide insight into each agent's decisions based on its state and the goal.
- **Modular Design:** Clear separation of environment, agent, training, and explanation components.
- **Advanced Techniques:** Integration of MARL and explainable AI for state-of-the-art research.
